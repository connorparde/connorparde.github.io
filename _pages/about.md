I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt University.

My research integrates psychophysics and deep learning to study how visual representations emerge in humans and machines. I use computational models as theory-building tools to understand perception, representation, and generalization in human and artificial vision systems.

My work combines behavioral experimentation, computational modeling, and analysis of representational structure, with a focus on high-level vision and face perception.
