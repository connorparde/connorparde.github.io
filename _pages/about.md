**I study how visual representations are learned and organized in humans and machines, using psychophysics and deep learning as complementary theory-building tools.**

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt University.

My research uses behavioral experimentation, computational modeling, and analyses of representational structure to understand perception, representation, and generalization in human and artificial vision systems, with a particular focus on high-level vision and face perception.
